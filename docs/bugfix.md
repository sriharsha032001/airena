Cursor Prompt for Instant Credit Deduction/Addition (No Page Refresh)
Implement real-time credit deduction and addition as follows:

After each response (successful completion, error, or manual credit addition), instantly update the user's credits on the frontend and backend without requiring a page reload or manual refresh.

As soon as the backend confirms the credits have been deducted or added, immediately update the displayed credit balance in the UI for the current user session.

Ensure the credit deduction/addition logic is atomic and synchronizedâ€”no race conditions or stale state (e.g., use optimistic UI updates, followed by reconciliation with backend if needed).

For all actions that affect credits (single model, comparison, premium, manual top-up), apply this real-time update flow.

The credits displayed on the screen must always reflect the current, accurate balance after every response or transaction, for all users.

Avoid showing stale credit values, even if the user opens a new tab or device (suggest using WebSocket/subscription or periodic polling as fallback for real-time sync).

This must work seamlessly for both deduction and addition of credits, regardless of how triggered.

Result:
Users always see their updated credits instantly after every response or transaction, without having to refresh the page.
